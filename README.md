# ADIF DXCC Viewer

**ADIF DXCC Viewer** is a simple Python GUI tool that reads your amateur radio ADIF log file and displays detailed DXCC statistics.

It shows:
- Total unique DXCC entities worked (mixed mode)
- DXCC entities per band
- QSO count per band
- QSO count per DXCC entity

The interface uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `tkinter` module. No external libraries or dependencies are required.
